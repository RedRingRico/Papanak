OVERVIEW

Papanak is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, and Pandora) cooperative survival
horror game in a first person perspective.

The focus of the game is on team work to get through a city overrun with undead
humans.  Your team needs to create some kind of signal for a helicopter to pick
up and land by if you are to be rescued.  There is a set amount of time until
the helicopter arrives and you need to ensure you are there when it lands.
