OVERVIEW

Papanak is a cross-platform (Linux, Windows, and Pandora) arena-based first
person shooter.

This is not a twitch shooter, it's more of a semi-tactical shooter.  Several
game modes will be available; deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag,
bombing run, and irregular orb.

The game will support up to 20 players over a network, as well as bot
characters.
